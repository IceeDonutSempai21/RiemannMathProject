# RiemannMathProject
This is our group's semester two maths project. Our topic is Riemann sums, which approximate the area underneath a polynomial curve.

# What is this?

This is our part of our "physical product" which we will demonstrate on presentation day. It is a web based application intended to assist with finding the surface area of two-dimensional objects with curves, that could otherwise not be easily or quickly measured. The end goal is to be able to, on any* device with an internet connection and camera, measure some kind of 2D object. A practical example of this would be the soon-to-be-implemented toast calorie counter, which tells the user how many calories are in one slice of toast based on our web app's calculations and bread type.

*Any device refers to any modern device that has no issues with whatever we decide to stick in here

# How does it work?

At the moment, a live camera feed and some nice UX is implemented. The live camera feed only functions on non-mobile devices due to issues with video autoplay and other camera features we are using. This will get updated with a fix soon.

In the future, a canvas will allow users to draw fluid curves tracing their object which will automatically calculate the area after the fact. More details can be found on our projects boards for this repository.

Goal: Construct a cross-platform, mobile-targeted application which allows users to take a picture of an object and figure out the area of one face.
